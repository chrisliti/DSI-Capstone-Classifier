![alt text](https://github.com/chrisliti/DSI-Capstone-Classifier/blob/main/Tomato_img4.jpg)

## Overview
This repo contains code for developing the convolution neural network (CNN) for classifying plant diseases. For this project only maize and tomato plants will be considered. The model developed in this script will be exported and deployed on a web application.

## Project Files

1. Capstone-Model-VGG19.h5: Exported custom trained model.
2. app.py: Classification web application development script.
3. plant_diseases.pkl: Pickle dictionary of train diseases.
4. requirements.txt: Text file for required libraries and dependencies.
